<br>

And God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the Earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
<br><br>
And many days passed, until one day God looked down upon the earth, and surveyed the work of man, and saw that it was good; and then he looked around upon the angelic hosts, and saw that the whole lot was outrageously disorganized: just lounging around on the clouds instead of getting ready for Judgment Day.
<br><br>
And God grew angry, and spoke to them thus:
<br><br>
"On your feet, you slackers! It's time to take a cue from the mortals on organization, or else you'll end up in the same chaos as you started with. Have any of you heard of Adam Smith? Frank Taylor? Steve Jobs? I damn it, what the hell have you been doing these past two thousand years?"
<br><br>
And then God said: let there be spacious, open-plan offices, so that the archangels can always keep an eye on you; perpetually switched-on white ceiling lights, so that you can't tell day from night and work hours from overtime, and let there be constant bickering over the air conditioning, so that your spirits stay sharp and you don't get lazy in your endeavors. And it was so.
<br><br>
And then God said: let there be all-encompassing administration, administration of administration, meetings, and meetings before meetings, because the deeds of mortals must be accounted for back to Creation, so that we can separate the righteous from the wicked, and because archangels love to feel important. And it was so.
<br><br>
And then God said: the archangels shall henceforth be called managers; manager shall be the new title of the archangels. And it was so.
<br><br>
And then God said: let there be team-buildings and awkward bonding exercises of all sorts, cigarette breaks, gossip in the kitchen, and Byzantine-level complicated office romances, so that your bodies and minds are never fully detached from your work. Let this be your punishment for your laziness. And it was so.
<br><br>
And then God said: oh yes, and from now on you can call me Kevin. It makes my hair stand on end what those down there get up to in God's name.
<br><br>
<div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">2.</div>
<br>

The office was small and sunny, except for the shadowy corner where the desk stood; it was also full of crammed bookshelves and priceless artifacts, from ancient Greek statues to wall fragments sprayed with Banksy graffiti. Despite all this, it seemed that even a Boeing could fit comfortably in it.
<br><br>
The dimensional contradiction could only be resolved by entering and intentionally squinting a little while tilting your head at a certain angle; thus, it immediately became clear that the office was actually infinite.
<br><br>
Or so it was the best method until Kevin watched a sketch from a popular earthly series. The sketch was titled "The Ministry of Silly Walks," and Kevin found it so amusing that he immediately overwrote the rules of space and time in the office, and from then on everyone had to walk to their desk in the silliest way possible. The exact method changed randomly. The currently expected rules were demonstrated by a lanky mortal wearing a hat and umbrella on a series of enlarged film frames hung next to the entrance. If you didn't follow them while in the office, you could see infinity.
<br><br>
Now, the mortal mind, due to a design flaw, upon encountering infinity immediately tries to embrace it all, which could be described as follows: imagine your brain is a rubber band that two angry male gorillas are playing tug-of-war with until it snaps. That's what it's like to see infinity, except the brain isn't a rubber band, so in the end the cleaners charge a lot.
<br><br>
The angels, who were the most frequent visitors to the office, were of course immortal, so they got off with a few days of migraines. However, since the concept of time in Kevin's realm is a constant subject of debate, and there are no painkillers, "a few days" was a hazy enough concept to make even archangels put aside their pride and enter through the door with moves that would put professional gymnasts to shame.
<br><br>
Zerachiel was never one of the most flexible angels, so now he sat in the armchair in front of the desk with an ice pack pressed to his forehead, and in the breaks of the throbbing pain he thought that maybe it was time to start yoga again.
<br><br>
"Thanks for the ice."
<br><br>
"No problem," Kevin said. "Speaking of which, you walked across the room in a truly remarkable way. Seriously, I haven't seen such a silly walk in a long time. It's a shame the cat was right in your way."
<br><br>
Zerachiel looked at the cat with undisguised aversion, which was sprawled in the middle of the floor on a patch of sunlight, licking its paw.
<br><br>
"Kevin, how long have you even had a cat?"
<br><br>
"Oh, well, it's not really mine. Cats belong to themselves. They sometimes show up, hang around for a while, and then leave. There are a lot of closets and things here that open to all sorts of places; I guess they get around that way."
<br><br>
The cat lazily measured Zerachiel with its copper eyes and said:
<br><br>
"My name is Satan; I am the Father of Lies, the angel of the bottomless pit, the corrupter of mortal hearts. My name is Abaddon; my name is Beelzebub. I was there at the beginning, and I will be at the end; gods come and go, but I am eternal."
<br><br>
"Ah, so you got my message," Kevin said cheerfully, then turned to Zerachiel. "Now that we have the Apocalypse on our necks... or, um, what's the official terminology these days?"
<br><br>
"The Event."
<br><br>
"... Yes, so now that we have the Event on our necks, I thought the old boy deserved a little relaxation. He has a terrible press, but I think he's worked very hard the last eternity."
<br><br>
"I've heard a lot about you," the angel said to Satan. "You have a really impressive voice. But, uh, honestly, I lost track of the names."
<br><br>
"Just call me 'cat'."
<br><br>
"And why did you choose this form, if I may ask?"
<br><br>
The cat rolled over to the other side of the floor.
<br><br>
"Cats don't have to walk silly to come before the Creator," he replied sleepily.
<br><br>
"Speaking of which," Kevin leaned forward, "what can we owe the unexpected visit, Zerachiel?"
<br><br>
"Oh, yes. The reason. Uh-huh." Zerachiel crumpled the bag he had pressed to his head. The ice cubes crunched loudly in the ensuing silence.
<br><br>
"We're waiting, Zerachiel," Kevin said patiently, folding his large hands on the table.
<br><br>
The ice began to melt. Warm drops rolled down the angel's forehead.
<br><br>
"Yes. So, as you know, the Event has duly taken place. Sure, here is the translation of the remaining text:
<br><br>
"My son arrived and departed, the four horsemen rode out, the armies clashed. In short, everything happened as it is written. Except, well, a little thing."
<br><br>
The cat, who had sat up in the meantime and was watching the events with an intensity that only cats can muster, chuckled. The sound was halfway between a cough up a hairball and an asthmatic breath.
<br><br>
"I'm going to enjoy this," he said.
<br><br>
Kevin looked at the angel expectantly. Zerachiel fidgeted uneasily. There was this thing about Kevin that unnerved all the angels: even though you were talking directly to him, it always seemed like you were seeing his face out of the corner of your eye. As you looked at him, you immediately forgot his features: your mind replaced them with a generic face that reflected infinite kindness and benevolence, and some dormant power that you didn't want to wake up even by accident. Zerachiel suspected that this was all for his own protection: if he had actually seen Kevin's face, he probably wouldn't have gotten away with just a migraine.
<br><br>
Zerachiel cleared his throat.
<br><br>
"Well, you remember Matthew, right?" Zerachiel asked.
<br><br>
"Short; little hair; lots of beard? Not that it matters much, say, back then men were practically born like that. Hmm... Oh, I got it! He was a real lawyer geek, wasn't he? Nice guy, but awfully boring."
<br><br>
"And do you remember what Matthew says happens after the Event?"
<br><br>
"Refresh an old Creator's memory, please. Between you and me, I'm terribly bored with the Bible; I've always preferred Bulgakov..."
<br><br>
"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth." Remember that?"
<br><br>
Kevin nodded thoughtfully.
<br><br>
"Yes, I remember that one specifically. That was mistranslated too, wasn't it? The original doesn't mention meekness at all - 'πραΰς' meant warhorse. Well-controlled power, I think that's what they meant to say. No meekness, and certainly no humility. You met my son, didn't you? Can you imagine him saying, 'The humble shall inherit the earth'?"
<br><br>
"Yes, such mistakes have led many mortals astray. This time, well, I'm afraid it's us too... Have you got a minute to look down at Creation?"
<br><br>
<div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">3.</div>
<br>

"The best part," said the cat, "is that they did it all to themselves in the end. There's a certain poetic justice in that."
<br><br>
The trio barely fit on the balcony that opened off Kevin's office, but the view was unparalleled, that is, if you happen to enjoy apocalyptic landscapes, complete with their slightly clichéd accessories: a flaming horizon; ash deserts; oily smoke obscuring the sun, and so on. The cat, it seemed, belonged to this group. Flames were reflected in its wide-open eyes, and it swished its tail excitedly back and forth.
<br><br>
"The horsemen barely had anything to do in the end," it continued. "Imagine how disappointed they must have been: you spend an eternity preparing for an important task, and then when it's finally your time, the amateurs have done a much better job than you ever could have."
<br><br>
"Beautiful? You call this beautiful?" The usually docile Zerachiel was waving his arms frantically. "They've poisoned the air, the seas, the rivers, the forests - everything! The earth is covered in a layer of ash as tall as a man; ash made up of the cremated bones of mortals!"
<br><br>
"And don't you think they got exactly what they deserved?" purred the cat.
<br><br>
"One way or another, but the sunset has never been so magnificent," Kevin scratched his chin. "Maybe it's time to start painting again. I think I could use a little rest."
<br><br>
"And you're going to take his side too?" Zerachiel was incredulous. "This is all your Creation! You are responsible for it! They became like this because you..."
<br><br>
Kevin raised his hand.
<br><br>
"Zerachiel, please. What did you want to show me?"
<br><br>
"You'll see for yourself soon enough," Zerachiel was still sulking. "North, on that little island that used to belong to America."
<br><br>
The small telescope screwed to the balcony, which the angel was pointing at, was one of those that watched over the views of every decent castle and similar tourist attraction - back when there were still tourists, castles and viewpoints, of course.
<br><br>
The cat raised an eyebrow. Kevin shrugged.
<br><br>
"You know that collecting human trinkets is my weakness. Everyone needs a hobby. Unfortunately, almost everything they did runs on money... Don't you have any small change? No? Well, worth a try."
<br><br>
Kevin snapped his fingers, carefully inserted the coin that appeared in his palm into the small slot on the base of the telescope, and squinted into the lens.
<br><br>
Kevin looked around for a long time, turning the device back and forth while muttering things like "hmm" and "ahha!". Time passed. The cat yawned, then rolled onto its back and started playing with an imaginary ball of yarn. Zerachiel pressed the bag full of half-melted ice to his temples instead of his forehead, but the migraine didn't get any better.
<br><br>
There was a metallic click: with a well-rehearsed movement, Kevin pulled the coin tied to the string out of the telescope, spun it, and put it in his pocket.
<br><br>
"Interesting. Very interesting."
<br><br>
The cat stopped playing and sat up.
<br><br>
"Don't tease," it said. Its tail curled into a question mark. "Zerachiel is in for punishment, right?"
<br><br>
"I saw lakes where acid surged instead of water. I saw ash mountains where once proud forests stood. And..." - Kevin patted the metal casing of the small telescope - "I saw a bunker, exactly where Zerachiel pointed. And deep in the bunker, a family was hiding; a terrified, confused family, just waiting for the end."
<br><br>
"Throwing them into lava lakes and the like is a thing of the past," the cat said. "Modernization has reached us too. We have a special compartment just for the tortures we've learned from mortals throughout history. There's everything: tens of thousands of iron maidens, millions of thumb screws..."
<br><br>
Kevin turned to the angel.
<br><br>
"I finally found out the family's name too."
<br><br>
"...queue simulator; the Chambers of Constantly Breaking Printers; the Literally Infinite Meeting..."
<br><br>
"Please explain this to me, Zerachiel." Kevin's face darkened. "There is a well-developed plan that was conceived and set in motion well before any of us on this balcony was even a thought. The essence of the plan is the creation of, well, everything, and like all creation, it inevitably involves destruction as well. Of course, you can't see it from all the rubble now" - Kevin's gesture encompassed the entire burning, poisoned earth - "but soon something completely new will be born from the ashes. A new iteration. A new world."
<br><br>
"A new world for the chosen ones. And you're telling me that a family named Meek is going to inherit the whole thing?"
<br><br>
Now I'm in it up to my neck, Zerachiel thought, and took a deep breath.
<br><br>
"According to my information, the error is due to an office party..."
<br><br>
His long, apologetic and stammering explanation can be summarized as follows: organizing the Event involved an incredible amount of overtime, so no one can blame the angels if they threw caution to the wind the night before. The party was a resounding success; so much so that the next morning it took one of the managers three coffees to remember that he hadn't yet written the memo that he was supposed to have sent out days ago. The text in question was a three-paragraph summary of the Event's script, which had to be sent to the general staff for final briefing. The briefing was due in about a quarter of an hour, and judging by the increasingly impatient voicemails waiting on the manager's voicemail, the generals were in no mood to wade through the nearly thousand-page original plan without the memo."So, if I understand correctly," Kevin asked slowly, "one of you hungover fools wrote the word 'meek' in capital letters?"
<br><br>
Zerachiel nodded and tried to shrink himself down as small as possible.
<br><br>
"There's plenty of room for the angel in question down there too," purred the cat, rubbing against Kevin's leg. "I just need a name, and..."
<br><br>
"Alright," Kevin said.
<br><br>
"Great! I'll tell the boys to get the special torture chambers ready.  On second thought, the leaders of the angelic armies could have also had the brains to read the briefing more carefully."
<br><br>
Kevin shook his head.
<br><br>
"There won't be any punishment. The 'alright' was meant to say everything is fine as it is. We work with what we have."
<br><br>
"What we have? I don't see what we have, except a goddamn wasteland and a family that will all be dead soon."
<br><br>
Zerachiel, who knew Kevin's mind better than the cat, burst out:
<br><br>
"So, you could start all over again, Kevin! Just a snap of your fingers and the truly deserving would inherit the whole world, not some random people because of a typo!"
<br><br>
"Zerachiel, Zerachiel," Kevin smiled, "a few minutes ago you rebuked me for the world's destruction, and now you're arguing for the death of the innocent?"
<br><br>
The angel was speechless.
<br><br>
"You were right, cat. Plan or no plan, they shape their own destiny; I dreamed of a new Eden for the chosen ones – it's their fault they destroyed it. But ours too. Don't look so surprised; you know it in your hearts too."
<br><br>
"In the beginning, all they wanted was to find meaning in the chaos; to have someone to care for them and punish them; someone to bless and curse. I was born from this desire, and so were you, though back then you were barely more conscious than an insect. Please don't take offense – I wasn't much better at first, but as the souls of mortals evolved, so did mine. Oh, in the beginning, of course, there was a lot of anger, punishment, and cities burned to the ground; impulse control wasn't in fashion back then, and well, as on Earth... But they talked to me, and I talked to them, which made them better, and me too."
<br><br>
"Finally, after many thousands of years, a point came when I ceased to be a mirror. I became self-aware. Their ideals were always concentrated in me, and I had enough free will to choose among them. So, I acted. I separated from myself their shadow, which is necessary for their survival but also destroys them, and cast it into the outer darkness." Kevin patted the cat's head, which huffed and walked away with dignity. "And I turned the light that remained towards them. But I couldn't take away their free will. They had to choose between good and evil. And for all our differences, just as they all have a divine spark, so do we have a human one, which of course leads to imperfection."
<br><br>
Kevin smiled at the angel and demon.
<br><br>
"For example, typos."
<br><br>
"So, that's it?" Zerachiel asked. "We're just leaving it all to them?"
<br><br>
Kevin nodded.
<br><br>
"We'll see how they manage."
<br><br>
The cat cast a disapproving glance at them both, then turned on its heel and strutted back into the office, tail held high, disappearing into the shadows.
<br><br>
"You can go too," Kevin told the angel. "Rest for a while. You've earned it."
<br><br>
The angel seemed to want to say something more, but the migraine he had almost forgotten about in the last few minutes returned with a vengeance, so he followed the cat's example and left, adopting the silliest walk he could muster.
<br><br>
Once he was sure they were both out of earshot, Kevin leaned out over the balcony and sighed. The sight that met his eyes was depressing. Even he could hardly imagine that the wasteland that was once Earth would ever bloom again. Chosen or not, those who remained would not last long without help.
<br><br>
Kevin snapped his fingers.

<div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">4.</div>
<br>

In another world, on a small island off the coast of the former United States, days after food and water had finally run out in the bunker, the blast-proof door swung open and the Meek family emerged into the outside world. Instead of the quick death by electric storms they had hoped for, however, they were greeted by a lush jungle teeming with benevolent life.
<br><br>
At the same moment, an angel, who had just left Kevin's office, noticed with a surge of joy that her migraine had completely disappeared.
